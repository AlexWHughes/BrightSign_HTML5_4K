# BrightSign HTML5 4K

This is a working **BrightAuthor:Connected** project file that lets you run web pages in true 4K resolution on XT3 units (XT243 / XT1143).

## 🚀 What is this?

This project forces a BrightSign player to **actually render** HTML5 content at **3840x2160 (4K)** — not just output it at 4K and secretly scale it from 1080p (which it loves to do).

This was tested on:
- BrightSign XT243 / XT1144
- BrightSign OS 8.5.64
- Chromium HTML5 engine (required)

## 🤷 Why does this exist?

Because absolutely **nobody else** has shared a properly working example.

Everything I found was either:
- Outdated  
- Vague  
- Or ended with _"this should work"_ (spoiler: it didn’t)

After too many late nights, firmware upgrades, widget rewrites, BrightSignOS reboots, and moments of quiet despair — I cracked it. And this file? This is the exact project I wish someone else had uploaded.

## 📁 What's Inside

- ✅ A working BA Connected project file: `4K HTML5.bpfx`
- 🌐 An HTML5 widget that loads `https://screenresolutiontest.com` to confirm native 4K rendering
- 🖥️ Canvas set to 3840x2160 — no stretching, no scaling
- 🔧 Clean `settings.json` with required registry tweaks

## ❓ Can't I just do this in BA Connected now?

Maybe! BrightSign may have patched some of this in later builds — but even now it can be fiddly, especially if you're on older OS versions or switching rendering engines.

I’m putting this here **just in case**, for the next person who wants to skip three days of yelling at their screen.

## 🧠 Real Talk

I seriously considered gatekeeping this.

Not out of ego — but because I sank way too many hours into this config. Testing, reboots, fiddling with registry overrides, yelling into the void of the BrightSign forums…

But I wouldn’t sleep at night if I didn’t share it.  
I *needed* this exact project when I started — so here it is. For whoever needs it next.

You're welcome.  
This stupidly simple file cost me more than money.

Good luck.
